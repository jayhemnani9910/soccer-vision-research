    "RF-DETR, a real-time, transformer-based object detection model, has been successfully applied to soccer player recognition, offering high accuracy and efficient performance. A specialized model, \"RF-DETR SoccerNet,\" has been developed by fine-tuning RF-DETR-Large on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet).\n\nThis fine-tuned RF-DETR SoccerNet model is capable of detecting four essential classes in soccer videos: players, goalkeepers, referees, and the soccer ball[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet). It achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.7% at an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.50 (mAP@50) on the SoccerNet-Tracking 2023 dataset[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet). The model architecture utilizes RF-DETR-Large with a DINOv2 backbone and an input resolution of 1280x1280 pixels[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet).\n\nRF-DETR itself is an advancement in object detection, designed to overcome limitations of its predecessor, DETR, such as slow convergence, high computational demands, and underperformance in detecting small objects[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet). Its key innovations include multi-scale receptive field attention, optimized query embeddings, and efficient token interactions, which contribute to its real-time capabilities and adaptability across diverse domains[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet), [2](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr), [3](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/roboflows-rf-detr/), [4](https://universe.roboflow.com/football-ai-assistent/rf-detr-football-0vivy). This makes it well-suited for dynamic environments like soccer matches, where quick and accurate detection of multiple, often small and overlapping, objects is crucial.\n\nWhile RF-DETR SoccerNet provides professional-grade analysis for soccer broadcasts, it's noted as being out-of-scope for non-soccer sports, amateur footage, or real-time applications requiring extremely low latency (under 10ms)[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet). However, its overall performance demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of using RF-DETR for robust soccer player recognition and related object detection tasks in professional contexts.",
    "SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2), a state-of-the-art model developed by Meta AI, is highly effective for soccer player recognition through its advanced video object segmentation and tracking capabilities. It significantly streamlines the process of identifying and following moving objects in video footage, making it particularly useful for sports analytics[1](https://docs.labellerr.com/features/sam-2-object-tracking), [2](https://www.sievedata.com/blog/ball-tracking-with-sam2).\n\nKey aspects of SAM2's application in soccer player recognition include:\n*   **AI-driven, Frame-by-Frame Tracking** SAM2 offers automated, highly accurate tracking of objects across video frames. This means it can follow individual soccer players throughout an entire match video, even with dynamic camera movements and changes in scene[1](https://docs.labellerr.com/features/sam-2-object-tracking), [2](https://www.sievedata.com/blog/ball-tracking-with-sam2).\n*   **Handling Occlusions and Out-of-Frame Moments** A crucial feature for sports analysis, SAM2 is designed to efficiently manage instances where players are temporarily hidden behind other players or objects (occlusion) or move outside the camera's view[1](https://docs.labellerr.com/features/sam-2-object-tracking).\n*   **Compatibility with Multiple Label Types** The model can be used to track various objects simultaneously, such as individual players and the ball, allowing for comprehensive analysis of on-field action[1](https://docs.labellerr.com/features/sam-2-object-tracking), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG7HjcpsxGs).\n*   **Reduced Manual Annotation Effort** Platforms integrating SAM2, like Labellerr, boast up to 10x faster video object tracking compared to traditional manual annotation. Users can initiate tracking by providing point prompts on an object (e.g., a player) in a keyframe, and SAM2 then automatically segments and tracks that object across the entire video timeline[1](https://docs.labellerr.com/features/sam-2-object-tracking), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG7HjcpsxGs).\n*   **Applications in Sports Analytics** The precise tracking data generated by SAM2 can be leveraged for various sports analytics applications, including automated highlight detection, creating mobile-first content, enhancing visualizations (e.g., 3D replays), and advanced analytics like generating player movement heatmaps and predictive patterns[2](https://www.sievedata.com/blog/ball-tracking-with-sam2).\n*   **Architecture and Functionality** SAM2 builds upon its predecessor, extending its segmentation capabilities from static images to videos. It utilizes an image encoder and a mask decoder, with prompts (such as points or bounding boxes) guiding the segmentation process to output masked objects[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQY9Bk-ISA). While it benefits from initial prompts, some systems can automate this with other object detection models like YOLOv8 for tasks such as ball tracking[2](https://www.sievedata.com/blog/ball-tracking-with-sam2).",
    "SigLIP, a powerful multimodal AI model, holds significant potential for recognizing soccer players by leveraging its advanced image and text understanding capabilities. Built upon the framework of CLIP but utilizing a sigmoid loss function, SigLIP excels in tasks such as zero-shot image classification and generating dense image embeddings[1](https://roboflow.com/model/siglip), [2](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/notebooks/siglip-zero-shot-image-classification-with-output.html), [3](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/googles-siglip/), [4](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/siglip). This makes it well-suited for identifying and distinguishing players in complex soccer environments.\n\nHere's how SigLIP could be used for soccer player recognition:\n\n*   **Zero-Shot Player Identification:** SigLIP's zero-shot classification ability allows it to identify players or categorize them based on textual descriptions without requiring prior training on specific player images. For instance, given an image of a player and text prompts like \"player in a red jersey\" or \"goalkeeper,\" SigLIP could determine the best match, even for players it hasn't explicitly seen before[1](https://roboflow.com/model/siglip), [5](https://www.getorchestra.io/guides/zero-shot-image-classification-with-siglip), [2](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/notebooks/siglip-zero-shot-image-classification-with-output.html). This is particularly useful in dynamic sports environments where new players or kits are frequently introduced.\n*   **Generating Image Embeddings for Similarity Search and Clustering:** SigLIP can generate high-quality image embeddings, which are numerical representations of images[1](https://roboflow.com/model/siglip), [3](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/10/googles-siglip/), [6](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-c5acf9e28fce). These embeddings capture the essential visual features of a player. By comparing the embeddings of different player images, it's possible to determine their similarity. This enables:\n    *   **Player Clustering:** Grouping images of the same player together, even if they appear in different frames, poses, or lighting conditions. Research has already explored using SigLIP (and its successor, SigLIP 2) for player clustering in football, demonstrating its viability when proper normalization is applied[7](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-part-2-cf0c28c87632), [6](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-c5acf9e28fce).\n    *   **Re-identification:** Tracking a specific player across different camera angles or even different matches by matching their current image embedding to a known gallery of player embeddings.\n*   **Combining with Other Computer Vision Techniques:** While powerful on its own, SigLIP can be integrated with other techniques to enhance recognition accuracy and address specific challenges in soccer videos:\n    *   **Object Detection:** Initial player detection can be performed using object detection models to locate players within a frame. SigLIP can then be applied to the cropped player images for more granular identification. Traditional methods often use boosting-based detectors for this purpose[8](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf), [9](https://scispace.com/pdf/automatic-player-detection-labeling-and-tracking-in-4ealj2darh.pdf).\n    *   **Jersey Number Recognition:** For unambiguous identification, especially when multiple players wear similar kits, optical character recognition (OCR) can be used to read jersey numbers. This is a common practice in existing player tracking systems[8](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf). SigLIP could potentially aid in improving the robustness of jersey number extraction by providing rich visual context.\n    *   **Pose and Attribute Recognition:** SigLIP's understanding of image features could be extended to recognize specific player attributes (e.g., hair color, boots) or even typical player poses, which could further aid in distinguishing individuals.\n\nDespite these capabilities, recognizing soccer players presents several challenges, including significant variations in player pose, illumination, and scale, as well as frequent occlusions by other players[10](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/210113142_Soccer_Players_Identification_Based_on_Visual_Local_Features), [8](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf). The small size of players in broadcast video frames also makes feature extraction difficult[8](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf). However, SigLIP's ability to generate robust, semantically rich visual representations offers a promising avenue for developing more accurate and adaptable soccer player recognition systems. SigLIP 2, with its improvements in semantic understanding and localization, further strengthens this potential for sports analytics and broadcasting applications[11](https://huggingface.co/blog/siglip2).",
    "ResNet (Residual Network) plays a significant role in soccer player recognition, primarily by providing a robust backbone for deep learning models that handle various computer vision tasks in sports analytics. Its architecture, particularly the use of residual blocks and skip connections, addresses challenges inherent in training very deep neural networks, such as vanishing gradients, enabling more accurate and efficient player recognition systems.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/), [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380385580_Sports_Game_Classification_and_Detection_Using_ResNet50_Model_Through_Machine_Learning_Techniques_Using_Artificial_Intelligence), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10546033/), [4](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/13/1/207), [5](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/resnet-residual-neural-network/)\n\nHere's a breakdown of how ResNet is utilized in soccer player recognition:\n\n*   **Player Detection:** ResNet models, such as ResNet50, are frequently integrated as the backbone within object detection frameworks like Faster R-CNN, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and DETR (Detection Transformer). These frameworks leverage ResNet's strong feature extraction capabilities to accurately identify and localize soccer players within video frames or images.[6](https://medium.com/galang-imanta/deep-learning-for-detecting-football-players-using-convolutional-neural-network-tensorflow-and-a0158251ed7b), [7](https://labs.moongy.group/articles/real-time-player-tracking-in-football-a-deep-learning-approach), [8](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/player-detection-using-deep-learning-492122c3bf9), [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/), [9](https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/47356/hurault_mmsports_self.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10282031/) The residual connections in ResNet allow for the extraction of rich feature maps at multiple spatial resolutions, which is crucial for detecting players of varying sizes and appearances in a dynamic soccer environment.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/)\n\n*   **Player Identification and Re-identification:** Beyond simply detecting players, ResNet can be employed for more granular tasks like identifying specific individuals. This often involves:\n    *   **Jersey Number Recognition:** After detecting a player, a secondary deep learning model, sometimes also utilizing a ResNet architecture or fine-tuned vision-language models like SmolVLM2, can be used to recognize the numbers on their jerseys.[8](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/player-detection-using-deep-learning-492122c3bf9), [11](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1nv4d8u/basketball_players_recognition_with_rfdetr_sam2/), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10282031/)\n    *   **Face Recognition:** For specific player tracking or re-identification across different camera views or over time, pre-trained ResNet models on large face datasets like VGGFace2 can act as feature extractors within Siamese networks to calculate similarities between player face images.[12](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf)\n    *   **Team Classification:** Vision-language embeddings combined with unsupervised clustering techniques can utilize features extracted by models, potentially including ResNet, to separate players into teams based on uniform colors and textures.[11](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1nv4d8u/basketball_players_recognition_with_rfdetr_sam2/)\n\n*   **Addressing Challenges in Soccer Environments:** Soccer matches present several computer vision challenges that ResNet's architecture helps to mitigate:\n    *   **Occlusion:** Players frequently overlap or are partially obscured by other players or objects on the field. ResNet's ability to learn robust features helps in these challenging scenarios.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/), [13](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361961338_Deep_Learning-Based_Football_Player_Detection_in_Videos), [9](https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/47356/hurault_mmsports_self.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10282031/), [14](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-ResNet-architecture-for-formation-identification-once-the-player-locations-are_fig4_367976420)\n    *   **Varying Player Sizes:** Depending on the camera's distance and angle, players can appear at different scales. Models built with ResNet backbones, especially when combined with Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN), can effectively detect objects across various sizes.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/)\n    *   **Complex Backgrounds:** The dynamic nature of a soccer field with changing lighting conditions, crowds, and other elements can make player detection difficult. ResNet's deep learning capabilities enable it to differentiate players from background clutter.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/)\n\n*   **Integration and Workflow:** In practical applications, ResNet is often a component of a larger pipeline for soccer analytics. This pipeline may involve initial player detection, followed by jersey number or face recognition for individual identification, and then tracking algorithms (like Kalman filters) to follow players across multiple frames.[12](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf), [11](https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1nv4d8u/basketball_players_recognition_with_rfdetr_sam2/), [15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348487550_Evaluating_Soccer_Player_from_Live_Camera_to_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10282031/) Pre-trained ResNet models, fine-tuned on specific soccer datasets, are a common approach to achieve high accuracy in these tasks.[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380385580_Sports_Game_Classification_and_Detection_Using_ResNet50_Model_Through_Machine_Learning_Techniques_Using_Artificial_Intelligence), [16](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1273931/full), [17](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jeremiahchinyelugo/sports-classification-resnet50-94-acc) The goal of such systems is to provide valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and even improve the spectator experience through real-time data and performance analysis.[7](https://labs.moongy.group/articles/real-time-player-tracking-in-football-a-deep-learning-approach), [8](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/player-detection-using-deep-learning-492122c3bf9)"

    "For RF-DETR soccer player recognition, performance is typically evaluated using common object detection metrics, with specific results available for models fine-tuned on soccer datasets.\n\nKey performance metrics include:\n\n*   **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: This is a standard metric for object detection, combining both precision and recall. A higher mAP indicates better overall accuracy. RF-DETR models are often benchmarked using mAP across different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds.\n    *   **mAP@50**: This refers to the mean Average Precision calculated at an IoU threshold of 0.5. For an RF-DETR-Large model fine-tuned on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, a reported mAP@50 is 85.7%.[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet)\n    *   **mAP@75**: This represents the mean Average Precision at a stricter IoU threshold of 0.75. For the same SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, a mAP@75 of 52.0% has been achieved.[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet)\n    *   **mAP (overall)**: This often refers to the average mAP across various IoU thresholds (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.95 with steps of 0.05). For the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, an overall mAP of 49.8% is reported.[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet)\n*   **Inference Speed (Latency/FPS)**: This measures how quickly the model can process images or video frames. It's often expressed in milliseconds per image (ms/img) or frames per second (FPS). For general object detection, RF-DETR variants aim for real-time performance, with RF-DETR-Base achieving 6.0 ms/img on a T4 GPU.[2](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/roboflows-rf-detr/) For soccer player recognition, real-time performance is crucial for applications like live broadcast analysis.\n*   **Domain Adaptability**: RF-DETR is also evaluated on its ability to perform well on diverse datasets beyond common benchmarks like COCO, using benchmarks such as RF100-VL. This indicates its potential to adapt to the varied conditions and camera angles often found in soccer videos.[3](https://learnopencv.com/rf-detr-object-detection/), [2](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/roboflows-rf-detr/), [4](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/rf-detr-real-time-object-detection) RF-DETR has shown strong performance on RF100-VL, outperforming other models with an 86.7 mAP.[2](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/03/roboflows-rf-detr/)\n\nFor a fine-tuned RF-DETR-Large model specifically for soccer player recognition on the SoccerNet-Tracking dataset, the detected classes include soccer balls, field players, referees, and goalkeepers.[1](https://huggingface.co/julianzu9612/RFDETR-Soccernet)",
    "SAM2, or Segment Anything Model 2, demonstrates significant advancements in video object segmentation and tracking, making it applicable to soccer player recognition. Its performance is primarily evaluated through segmentation quality, processing speed, and its ability to handle complex real-world scenarios like occlusions.\n\nKey performance metrics for SAM2 in the context of object recognition and tracking, including its application to soccer players, are:\n\n*   **Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU):** This metric quantifies the accuracy of segmentation, measuring the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground-truth mask. SAM2 has shown improved segmentation accuracy over its predecessor, SAM, achieving a 1-click mIoU of 58.9% on the SA-23 benchmark, an improvement from SAM's 58.1%[1](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/deep-diving-into-sam2-how-quality-data-propelled-meta-s-visual-segmentation-model). This indicates a more precise delineation of objects, which is crucial for distinguishing individual players on a soccer field.\n*   **Frames Per Second (FPS):** This metric assesses the processing speed and real-time capability of the model. SAM2 boasts significantly faster inference speeds, being 6 times quicker than the original SAM[1](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/deep-diving-into-sam2-how-quality-data-propelled-meta-s-visual-segmentation-model), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.00714v1). Specifically, it achieves real-time processing speeds of 43.8 FPS for the Hiera-B+ variant and 30.2 FPS for the Hiera-L variant on a single A100 GPU[1](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/deep-diving-into-sam2-how-quality-data-propelled-meta-s-visual-segmentation-model). The large model can also reach 24.2 FPS[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQY9Bk-ISA). Such high frame rates are essential for tracking fast-moving players in live soccer footage.\n*   **Reduced User Interaction:** SAM2 is noted for achieving superior accuracy with three times fewer user interactions compared to previous approaches[1](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/deep-diving-into-sam2-how-quality-data-propelled-meta-s-visual-segmentation-model), [2](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.00714v1). This highlights its efficiency in practical annotation and tracking workflows.\n*   **Occlusion Handling:** A critical aspect of player recognition in soccer is the ability to maintain tracking despite occlusions (when players are partially or fully hidden). SAM2 incorporates a sophisticated memory mechanism to handle temporal dependencies and occlusions, allowing it to maintain consistent object tracking even when objects are temporarily obscured[4](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/sam-2/), [5](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/). It can properly segment objects even when occluded[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQY9Bk-ISA).\n\nWhile SAM2 is compatible with various label types, including \"player\"[6](https://docs.labellerr.com/features/sam-2-object-tracking), and can be used for \"football player segmentation\"[7](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hamzanabil/sam-2-football-player-segmentation), specific quantitative performance metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score directly tied to SAM2's performance on dedicated soccer player datasets were not explicitly detailed in the search results. However, these general metrics (mIoU, FPS, and occlusion handling capabilities) provide strong indicators of its potential performance for soccer player recognition and tracking tasks.\n\nIt is important to note some limitations: SAM2 may struggle with segmenting objects that have thin or fine details, especially when they are moving quickly. It can also lose track or confuse objects in crowded scenes, particularly after long occlusions or in extended videos, and may struggle with nearby objects of similar appearance[1](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/deep-diving-into-sam2-how-quality-data-propelled-meta-s-visual-segmentation-model), [4](https://www.labellerr.com/blog/sam-2/), [5](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/sam-2/). For fine-grained segmentation of complex object structures, SAM2's performance has been noted to be poor[8](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.02567v1).",
    "In the context of soccer player recognition, the performance of SigLIP models has been evaluated, primarily focusing on accuracy in player clustering tasks. Initial assessments indicated that SigLIP variants unexpectedly ranked lower in both speed and accuracy compared to models like ResNet-26 and CLIP[1](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-c5acf9e28fce).\n\nHowever, subsequent research demonstrated a notable improvement in SigLIP's performance. After adjusting normalization values, both the first and second generations of SigLIP models showed a significant boost in performance, achieving accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of CLIP and ResNet models[2](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-part-2-cf0c28c87632). The metric predominantly discussed in these evaluations is \"mean accuracy\" in clustering tasks[1](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-c5acf9e28fce), [2](https://medium.com/@szym.kulpinski/clustering-football-players-using-image-embeddings-umap-and-k-means-part-2-cf0c28c87632).\n\nWhile these studies highlight SigLIP's potential in tasks related to identifying and grouping soccer players, specific performance metrics commonly used in object detection and tracking, such as precision, recall, F1-score, or mean Average Precision (mAP), have not been explicitly reported for SigLIP in the provided search results regarding direct soccer player recognition or tracking. Other research on general soccer player tracking and technical action recognition frequently utilizes metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score[3](https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2020/89108/89108.pdf), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12012089/).",
    "ResNet (Residual Network) models demonstrate strong performance in soccer player recognition, with reported accuracy reaching as high as 97.72% for player identification and classification tasks.[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12334)\n\nKey performance metrics and findings include:\n*   **Player Identification/Classification Accuracy:** For the task of identifying or classifying individual soccer players, methods utilizing ResNet have achieved an accuracy of 97.72% on annotated benchmarks.[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12334)\n*   **Action Spotting (mAP):** In the context of action spotting in soccer videos, which involves identifying when specific key actions occur, a method combining ResNet with other audiovisual modalities obtained an overall performance of 57.83% average-mAP (mean Average Precision).[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12334)\n*   **Football Player Detection (Average Precision - AP):** In general football player detection in videos, a deep convolutional neural network architecture built on a feature pyramid network (FPN) with residual connections, which leverages ResNet's advantages, achieved high average precision scores. This model recorded an AP of 0.915 on the ISSIA-CNR dataset and 0.932 on a dedicated soccer player detection dataset.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9296282/)\n\nBeyond specific soccer applications, ResNet models, particularly ResNet50, are widely recognized for their high accuracy in general image recognition and classification tasks. For instance, ResNet50 has achieved an average accuracy of 66.5% in image classification, outperforming earlier CNN architectures like VGG16, InceptionV3, and AlexNet by 3-4% on average.[3](https://www.jisem-journal.com/index.php/journal/article/download/12143/5645/20404) Its architectural innovations, including residual blocks, batch normalization, and bottleneck convolutions, contribute to its ability to train very deep networks and learn complex features effectively.[3](https://www.jisem-journal.com/index.php/journal/article/download/12143/5645/20404), [4](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/resnet-residual-neural-network/)"
